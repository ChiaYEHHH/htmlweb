    <br>
    Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street <br>
    Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly <br>
    Loving him is like trying to change your mind <br>
    Once you're already flying through the free fall <br>
    Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it a <br>
    Losing him was blue, like I'd never known <br>
    Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
    Forgetting him was like trying to know <br>
    Somebody you never met <br>
    But loving him was red <br>
    Loving him was red <br>
    Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted <br>
    Was right there in front of you <br>
    Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words <br>
    To your old favorite song <br>
    Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword <br>
    And realizing there's no right answer <br>
    Regretting him was like wishing you never found out <br>
    That love could be that strong <br>
    Losing him was blue, like I'd never known <br>
    Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
    Forgetting him was like trying to know <br>
    Somebody you never met <br>
    But loving him was red <br>
    Oh, red
    Burning red
    Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes <br>
    Tell myself it's time now gotta let go <br>
    But moving on from him is impossible <br>
    When I still see it all in my head
    In burning red <br>
    Burning, it was red <br>
    Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known <br>
    Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
    Forgetting him was like trying to know <br>
    Somebody you never met <br>
    'Cause loving him was red <br>
    Yeah, yeah, red <br>
    Burning red <br>
    And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head <br>
    Comes back to me, burning red <br>
    Yeah, yeah <br>
    His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street <br>
